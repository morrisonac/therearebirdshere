            when they said those  <ol>
                <li>birds</li>
            </ol> <em>were</em> metaphors<br>
            for what is trapped<br>

            The  <ol>

            to root around for bread<br>
            the girl’s hands tear<br>
            and toss like confetti. No,<br>
            I don’t mean the bread is torn like cotton,<br>
            I said confetti, and no<br>
            not the confetti<br>
            a tank can make of a building.<br>
            I mean the confetti<br>
            a boy can’t stop smiling about<br>
            and no his smile isn’t much<br>
            like a skeleton at all. And no<br>
            his neighborhood is not like a war zone.<br>
            I am trying to say<br>
            his neighborhood<br>
            is as tattered and feathered<br>
            as anything else,<br>
            as shadow pierced by sun<br>
            and light parted<br>
            by shadow-dance as anything else,<br>
            but they won’t stop saying<br>
