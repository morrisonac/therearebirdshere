        <h1> There Are Birds Here</h1>
        <p>
            There are birds here,<br>
            so many birds here<br>
            is what I was trying to say<br>
            when they said those birds were metaphors<br>
            for what is trapped<br>
            between buildings<br>
            and buildings. No.<br>
            The birds are here<br>
            to root around for bread<br>
            the girl’s hands tear<br>
            and toss like confetti. No,<br>
            I don’t mean the bread is torn like cotton,<br>
            I said confetti, and no<br>
            not the confetti<br>
            a tank can make of a building.<br>
            I mean the confetti<br>
            a boy can’t stop smiling about<br>
            and no his smile isn’t much<br>
            like a skeleton at all. And no<br>
            his neighborhood is not like a war zone.<br>
            I am trying to say<br>
            his neighborhood<br>
            is as tattered and feathered<br>
            as anything else,<br>
            as shadow pierced by sun<br>
            and light parted<br>
            by shadow-dance as anything else,<br>
            but they won’t stop saying<br>
            how lovely the ruins,<br>
            how ruined the lovely<br>
            children must be in that birdless city.</p>
